# PF4J-Spring Getting Started Case
  Inspired by [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kU5XygBwT4)
  
## Step：
1、Run build and you can see the plug-ins in the plugins directory; <br/>
2、Start boot, main class name is 'PluginBootRunner'; <br/>
3、Open Browser Request：http://localhost:8080/say/name, you can see text: 'Hello, here is leung....,Hello，here is sunk....'. <br/>
